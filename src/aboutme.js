          Growing up under a Father who is a multi-media enthusiast, first a Photographer, then later owned a music recording and Video editing studio,
          being knowlegdeable in the field of film/audio/multi-media production came almost natural, especially for the fact that both Film editing & audio productions are now done using
          computer softwares like Adobe Premier pro, After effects, Logic, cubase and so on, I was able to grow and flourish in film making field easily even while recording success as a programmer and developer.
          In the last 10 years I have created Radio and TV/video Commercials for both companies and churches in both videos and animations, music videos,Nollywood features,shot films and montages.
